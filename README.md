# FaceDetection

This is a repository for face detection using opencv and python.
Use faces_train.py script to train the model and face.py to detect faces in real time.

Note that in order for the faces_train.py script to work you need to create a directory called image and then create as many folders inside of it as you wish, their names shall represent classes of objects you would want to detect, and finally each of these folders must contain the train data.
